# Greenhouse Fuzzy Logic Control System

<p align="justify">
This project is a fuzzy logic system designed to control the electric roof and water spills of a greenhouse using temperature, humidity, and light intensity sensors. The project involves developing fuzzy membership functions, generating rules, simulating the system in LabVIEW, and visualizing data on ThingSpeak.
</p>

## Key Features & Technologies

### 1- Design and Development of Fuzzy Logic System:

- **Sensors and Inputs:**

    - Temperature Sensor: Measures the temperature inside the greenhouse.

    - Humidity Sensor: Measures the humidity levels inside the greenhouse.

    - Light Intensity Sensor: Measures the intensity of light within the greenhouse.

- **Membership Functions:**

    - Inputs: Each sensor input is characterized by four trapezoidal membership functions.

    - Outputs: The system's responses (such as roof adjustment and water spill control) are defined by four triangular membership functions.

### 2- Rule Generation:

- **Fuzzy Rules:**

    - Utilized ChatGPT to generate the membership functions & the 64 rules of fuzzy logic system.

    - Utilized the Fuzzy System Designer to test and adjust the generated rules.

### 3- LabVIEW Simulation:

- **Development Environment:**

    - Utilized LabVIEW to develop and simulate the fuzzy logic system.

- **Block Diagrams:**

    - Created detailed block diagrams representing the logic and flow of data within the system.

- **Front Panels:**

    - Developed front panels for interactive simulation and visualization of inputs, outputs, and system states.

### 4- Visualization with ThingSpeak:

- **Integration:**

    - Integrated ThingSpeak for real-time data visualization and monitoring.

- **Data Visualization:**

    - Visualized sensor inputs and system outputs using charts (lines and bars) and widgets (numeric displays and gauges).

- **Monitoring:**

    - Monitored system performance and behavior through ThingSpeakâ€™s cloud-based platform, allowing remote access and analysis.

### 5- Data Handling:

- **Data Download:**

    - Downloaded data fields from ThingSpeak for further analysis and processing.

- **Data Processing:**

    - Fetched and processed specific elements from the downloaded data to assess system performance and make necessary adjustments.

## System Design & Implementation

### Overview
